# Generative Music

This repository contains materials of different kinds, all related to generative music. The repository is organized in the form of an Obsidian Vault, so you should get [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) first and then open the main directory as a *vault*.

The main directories contain:

- [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) 
- [Wotjia](https://intermorphic.com/) related patches and materials;
- [Norns Shield](https://monome.org/docs/norns/shield/) related scripts and materials;
-  miscellaneous materials and utilities.

Please note that, since these are mostly tools and recipes that I use for my own compositions, this repository does not involve any "issues" interactions. However, you can participate in [discussions](https://github.com/davideriboli/Generative-Music/discussions) and, through those, propose contributions and/or changes. You will also find useful information on the [wiki](https://github.com/davideriboli/Generative-Music/wiki). 

Everything created by me and published here is released under the MIT License. Materials by other authors are released under their respective licenses.
